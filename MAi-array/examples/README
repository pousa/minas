In this folder there are six examples of how use MAi interface. The examples cover the utilization of the majority of MAi functions.

test_struct: is an example with arrays of structs and how to use MAi with this type of variables. In this examples some memory policies are used.
test_threads: is a more complete example with more operations.
test_mempol: is an example of how use MAi interface to construct our own memory policy.
jacobi: is jacobi problem implemented with posix threads.

test_fortran: simple example of hwo to use MAi in fortran
test_fomp: an example of MAi usage with OpenMP and fortran 

To execute the examples you just have to compile them and link with libmai. 
After the compilation, to run the examples you can use configuration files to specify nodes/cpu/cores that you want to use to execute the application. Some configuration files examples is also in the folder. If you do not want to specify nodes/cpu/cores MAi will select them for you.

conf2.cf - use two nodes and two cpus/cores
conf8.cf - use eight nodes and eight cpus/cores
