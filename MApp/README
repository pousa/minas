Memory Affinity preprocessor - MApp

The Memory Affinity preprocessor allows developers to automatically optimize memory affinity in theirs applications. 
All optimizations made by MApp considers NUMA platforms as target architecture.
The main objective of this preprocessor is to deal with memory placement using MAi interface in a transparent and simple way. 
MApp make optimizations of memory placement using the source code of the application and generate a preprocessed code
as output of the optimization process. All memory affinity optmizations are made for glogal and large arrays. The large
concept is defined before use MApp in a configuration file.
 
Requirements
	MApp need the libmai Interface.

Compiling
	To compile just tape 'make' at the top directory.
	The makefile will generate and install mapp in the MApp/bin/ directory.

How to use MApp
	To use MApp programmers have to pre-compile your source code with MApp
        Mapp [option] [FILE].c
        Then compile the transformed code with any compiler
