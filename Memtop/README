 
 Memtop is a tools displaying the memory usage among NUMA nodes of variable of a program.
 
0 - Requirements
	Memtop need the libnuma library.
	Memtop need the ncurses library.
	Memtop need the pthread library.

1 - Compiling
	To compile just tape 'make' at the top directory.
	The makefile will create a static library named 'libmemon' in the lib directory and a binary named 'memtop' in the bin directory.

2 - How to use memtop
	First you need to call in the targeted programs the methods of the libmemon library.
	You need to call init_memon() before any others methods of the library and finalize_memon()
	to finalize the use of memtop.
	To see the memory mapping of some variables you can use the method attach_memory() and detach_memory().
	Then, you just need to link your programs with the libmemon library.

	To display the memory usage and mapping of attached variables you must launch memtop binary.
	Be aware to start it before to launch your targeted programs.

 	The information displayed by memtop for each varaible:
	- memory policy associated with the variable (from HeapAlloc or MAi)
	- physical and virtual memory consumption 
	- memory mapping among nodes

	memtop and libmemon are developped by the french INRIA institut and under the GNU Public License v.2
